# Mernstack E-Commerce App - **BBMark**

https://bbmark.vercel.app/

-In the project, **MongoDB**, **Nodejs**, **Context API**, **React**, **Tailwind** were used as technology.
-I added data to mongodb cloud. Then I pulled it to the backend side and tried to make the routes, controllers and models by looking at a few different projects.

There are member login and registration options in the project. You can see the order you placed on the profile page. You can add and remove products to the cart. I have set up protected route on the admin side and only the person who is determined as admin from mongodb can enter here. On the admin side, there are options to add new products, modify or delete products, and view orders.
